    "    The conventions of using `x` for \"real-space\" and `k` for \"fourier space\" arise from cosmology, but this does\n",
    "    not affect anything -- `x` could just as well stand for \"time domain\" and `k` for \"frequency domain\".\n",
    "    The important convention is the relationship between `x` and `k`, or in other words, whether `k` is interpreted\n",
    "    as an angular frequency or ordinary frequency. By default, because of cosmological conventions, `k` is an\n",
    "    angular frequency, so that the fourier transform integrand is delta_k*exp(-ikx). The conventions can be changed\n",
    "    arbitrarily by setting the ``a,b`` parameters (see :mod:`powerbox.dft` for details).\n",
    "    The primary quantity of interest is :meth:`delta_x`, which is a zero-mean Gaussian field with a power spectrum\n",
    "    equivalent to that which was input. Being zero-mean enables its direct interpretation as an overdensity\n",
    "    field, and this interpretation is enforced in the :meth:`make_discrete_sample` method.\n",
    "    .. note:: None of the n-dimensional arrays that are created within the class are stored, due to the inefficiency\n",
    "              in memory consumption that this would imply. Thus, each large array is created and *returned* by their\n",
    "              respective method, to be stored/discarded by the user.\n",
    "    .. warning:: Due to the above note, repeated calls to eg. :meth:`delta_x()` will produce *different* realisations\n",
